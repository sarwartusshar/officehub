# OfficeHub for Office 365

### Summary

This solution is a sample solution on how to integrate AngularJS and the Microsoft Graph. The mission of this sample is to give you simple guidance on the authentication pieces and how to call the Microsoft Graph from within a fully client-site application like the OfficeHub.

Because of the cloud nature of the Microsoft Graph, this solution will work in an Office 365 and Azure environment but the approach shown in this sample won't work in an on premises installation of Exchange or SharePoint.

Here is what you get with this sample:
- Automatic authentication with AngularJS and the Microsoft Graph
- Use of the Exchange API within the Microsoft Graph
- Use of the OneDrive API within the Microsoft Graph

This solution is implemented using:

- NodeJS : Task runner enabling pretty much every other dependencies
- Bower : A component manager targeting JavaScript and CSS libraries
- Yeoman : Used as its scaffolding engine
- gulp-angular : Base scaffolding generator
- Visual Studio Code : IDE used to develop and store project specific settings
- jQuery : Because jQuery (!)
- AngularJS 1.5 : Base SPA framework
- ADAL : Azure Active Directory Authentication Library javascript implementation
- angular-adal : Specific AngularJS implementation of ADAL
- Office UI Fabric : CSS framework easing the layout of the application (because I'm lazy) and components
- ngOfficeUiFabric : AngularJS set of directives allowing an easy integration of the Office UI Fabric in views

The entire solution is self-contained as a website that can be hosted on any platform you want. In this scenario, I chose to host my client-side application on a NodeJS web server on Microsoft Azure.

### Applies to
-  Office 365 Multi Tenant (MT)
-  Office 365 Dedicated (D)
